# Wiring Map: Which Wire Goes Where

This table tells you which pin on the board each wire connects to, for the **Arduino Nano ESP32**.

This button box has **8 toggle switches**: SW1–SW6 are **ON-ON** (2-position) and SW7–SW8 are
**ON-OFF-ON** (3-position, with the center position doing nothing). Every switch has three
terminals: the two outer terminals (pin 1 and pin 3) each go to a signal pin, and the center
terminal (pin 2) goes to **GND**.

**How to read a row:** find the switch (e.g. "SW1"), look at which terminal it is ("Pin 1"), then
run a wire from that terminal to the pin listed in the board's column. Pin names like `D13` or
`A0` are printed on the board itself. Every switch's center terminal (pin 2) connects to **GND**
(ground), see the last row.

The "Virtual HID Button" column is just for reference: it's the button number the sim sees when
you flip that switch into that position. You don't wire anything for it.

> 💡 Each switch terminal has one wire to its signal pin (from this table) and the center terminal
> wires to **GND**. No resistors or extra parts needed; the firmware handles that.
